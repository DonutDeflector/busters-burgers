# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Premise

I created a mock website for a burger joint in a made up location.

### Home Page

The `home page` contains reasons to dine at the restaurant, pictures of the
features that the restaurant possses, and the restaurant's hours of operation.

### About Page

The `about page` contains information pertaining to the founding, expansion, and
current management of the restaurant.

### Menu

The `menu page` contains the dishes and drinks served at the restaurant.

### Contact

The `contact page` contains a dummy contact form as well as other ways to
contact the fake burger joint.

## Libraries Used

1.[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This one was required. I
customized a lot of the defaults and used the grid system a bunch.

2.[Ribbon](https://codepen.io/team/css-tricks/pen/mVZGKa) - This CSS Tricks
snippet was slightly modified and allowed me to make those cool ribbon-style
captions.

3.[Angled Slants](https://github.com/NigelOToole/angled-edges) - I tweaked this
mixin to allow me to create those cool looking slanted sections in the page.
