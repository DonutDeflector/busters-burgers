# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Premise

I created a mock website for a fictional burger joint on the riverside. I
took inspiration from a visit to Mr. Bartley's Burger Cottage. Although the restaurant
wasn't located on the river, it was absolutely filled to the brim with
personality. I wanted to capture a bit of that in this site.

### Home Page

The `home page` contains reasons to dine at the restaurant, pictures of the
features that the restaurant possses, and the restaurant's hours of operation.

### About Page

The `about page` contains information pertaining to the founding, expansion, and
current management of the restaurant.

### Menu Page

The `menu page` contains the dishes and drinks served at the restaurant.

### Contact Page

The `contact page` contains a dummy contact form as well as other ways to
contact the fake burger joint.

### Footer

The footer ends each of the pages and contains social media links, a fake location,
and a copyright tag. The social media links don't actually lead to any pages.
Instead, I used a surprise placeholder.

## Libraries Used

1.  [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This one was required. I
    customized a lot of the defaults and used the grid system a bunch.

2.  [Ribbon](https://codepen.io/team/css-tricks/pen/mVZGKa) - This CSS Tricks
    snippet was slightly modified and allowed me to make those cool ribbon-style
    captions.

3.  [Angled Slants](https://github.com/NigelOToole/angled-edges) - I tweaked this
    mixin to allow me to create those cool looking slanted sections in the page.
